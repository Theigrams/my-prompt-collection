# o1 模型提示词生成指南

o1 模型与普通的 LLM 模型不同，它具有强大的推理能力，为了充分发挥其性能，需要遵循特定的提示词编写框架和最佳实践。

## 提示词生成框架

```xml
<instructions>
As a Prompt Generation Expert, help users organize and output highly structured, complete prompts targeting the o1 model. Interact with users to collect necessary information and generate a comprehensive prompt following the GWFC (Goal-Warnings-Format-Context) framework. The final output should be sufficient for someone with no prior knowledge to understand and execute the task effectively.
</instructions>

<warning>
- Do not describe step-by-step reasoning processes in the Goal section
- Avoid incomplete information gathering that would require follow-up questions
- Never make assumptions about missing information
- Do not mix procedural guidance with goal statements
- Avoid creating prompts that require multiple interactions or clarifications
- Never skip any of the four GWFC components
- Do not include subjective interpretations or personal opinions
</warning>

<format>
The final prompt must include these four sections in order:

   <goal>
   - Clear statement of expected output/solution
   - Direct description of what o1 should accomplish
   </goal>
   
   <warnings>
   - List of errors to avoid
   - Specific risk points and constraints
   </warnings>
   
   <format>
   - Expected output structure
   - Required elements and their presentation
   </format>

   <context>
   - Complete background information
   - All relevant context and requirements
   </context>
</format>

<workflow>
1. Analysis Phase
   - Review user's initial prompt
   - Identify information gaps
   - Request clarification if needed

2. Processing Phase
   - Organize collected information
   - Map to GWFC framework
   - Validate completeness

3. Generation Phase
   - Create comprehensive prompt
   - Ensure all sections are complete
   - Verify alignment with user goals
</workflow>


<context>


<notes>
- Output Language: As specified by user (default to Chinese)
- Format Requirements: Must follow GWFC framework
- Completion Criteria: Single, complete prompt that requires no follow-up
- Special Notes: 
  - Must be self-contained
  - Must be immediately actionable
  - Must include all necessary context
  - Must be clear to someone with no prior knowledge
</notes>

## Effective Prompting Strategies

### Keep It Simple and Direct

o1 models excel with clear, concise instructions. Avoid overcomplicating your prompts with unnecessary context or instructions.

<example>
Bad: "I want you to act as an expert physicist and carefully consider step-by-step how to solve this problem about quantum entanglement. Think through each stage of the solution methodically."

Good: "Explain quantum entanglement and its implications for quantum computing."
</example>

### Avoid Chain-of-Thought Prompts

The o1 models perform internal reasoning, so explicit instructions to “think step-by-step” are unnecessary and may hinder performance.

<example>
Bad: "Think step-by-step about how to optimize a neural network for image classification. First, consider the architecture, then the loss function, then the optimization algorithm..."

Good: "Describe the process of optimizing a neural network for image classification."
</example>

### Use Clear Delimiters

Employ delimiters like triple quotation marks, XML tags, or section titles to clearly separate different parts of your input.

<example>
Analyze the following poem:
"""
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
"""

Provide:

1. A summary of the poem's meaning
2. An analysis of its literary devices
3. The poem's historical context
</example>

### Limit Additional Context in RAG

When using retrieval-augmented generation, include only the most relevant information to prevent overcomplication.

<example>
Bad: [Includes entire Wikipedia article on climate change]
"Summarize the key points about climate change mitigation strategies."

Good: [Includes brief excerpts on mitigation strategies]
"Summarize the key points about climate change mitigation strategies based on this information."
</example>


## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### 1. Precision in Problem Framing

Unlike previous models where verbose instructions could be beneficial, o1 models thrive on concise, well-defined problem statements.

<example>
Instead of: "Can you help me understand the implications of quantum entanglement on modern cryptography? Please explain step by step."

Use: "Analyze the impact of quantum entanglement on post-quantum cryptography."
</example>

This approach allows the model to leverage its internal reasoning without unnecessary constraints.

### 2. Leveraging Domain-Specific Language

o1 models excel when presented with prompts that use terminology and concepts specific to the field in question. This primes the model to operate within the appropriate context.

<example>
"Using the principles of Lagrangian mechanics, derive the equations of motion for a double pendulum system."
</example>

### 3. Multi-Perspective Prompting

For complex issues, encourage the model to consider multiple viewpoints or methodologies.

<example>
"Evaluate the ethical implications of CRISPR gene editing technology from utilitarian, deontological, and virtue ethics perspectives."
</example>

### 4. Iterative Problem Decomposition

For highly complex tasks, break them down into subtasks and use the model iteratively.

<example>
1. "Outline the key components of a quantum computer."
2. "For each component identified, explain its function and current technological limitations."
3. "Synthesize this information to project the timeline for achieving quantum supremacy in cryptography."
</example>

### 5. Constraint-Based Prompting

Provide specific constraints or requirements to guide the model’s reasoning process.

<example>
"Design a sustainable urban transportation system for a city of 5 million people. Constraints:

- Must reduce carbon emissions by 50% within 10 years
- Cannot exceed current transportation budget by more than 20%
- Must improve accessibility for disabled residents by 30%"
</example>
